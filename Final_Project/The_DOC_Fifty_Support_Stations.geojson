Hikers must maintain a 27min/mile pace to meet the next cutoff time. During this leg, hikers will summit Mount Mist, which is very underwhelming unfortunately.

From here, hikers will ascend Mt. Moosilauke and follow the Appalachian Trail all the way to Dartmouth's campus. At around 6.82 miles and 2451 ft of elevation gain, hikers must hike at a 39min/mile pace to meet the next cutoff time. Cutoff times are hard cutoff times after which it is dangerous for groups to continue hiking. During this leg, hikers will summit Mt. Moosilauke, a popular Dartmouth peak.\n\nThis year, we had 29 teams apply, of which we took 8 based off of a weighted lottery system. We ended up taking a 9th team due to extenuating circumstances, for a total of 36 hikers, all of which were '25s. \n\nHere at Moosilauke, teams were both excited and nervous to begin their long trek back to campus. Supporters were here cheering groups on and helping them with whatever they needed to be successful. " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -71.815957091268473, 43.99338205 ] } },

It is designated as an official A.T. parking lot, but is really just a small dirt patch at the side of the road. Here, hikers are served burritos and tortilla chips. \n\nAt this station, hikers began to encounter wet feet due to flooded and muddy trails. Here, I treated dozens of blisters and pulled 5 ticks. But morale was high and hikers were still excited. At this point, only one hiker had to be pulled due to an injury going down Mt. Moosilauke. \n\nThe next leg of the hike is 9 miles and 2297 ft of elevation gain. Hikers must maintain a 30min/mile pace to meet the next cutoff time. During this leg, hikers will summit Mt. Cube. This is an exposed summit, so I was concerned about thunder and lightning. Luckily, this turned out to not be an issue.

It is at the intersection of Jacob's Brook and the A.T.. The access this point, we had to coordinate with the landowner who generously opens his gate and allows us to use the service road to set up this support station. By now, it is also dark and buggy. Here, hikers are served hot soup and grilled cheese, as well as snacks. \n\nAt this point, you can tell that people are beginning to falter, with energies quickly draining. Once hikers sit down and eat soup, it was difficult to get back up. At this station, 5 hikers were pulled for missing the cutoff time, injuries, nerves, etc. \n\nThe next leg of the hike is 8.8 miles and 2184 ft of elevation gain. Here, hikers will summit Smarts Mountain. This is where most hikers get lost during the Fifty due to fatigue, darkness, and unclear trails. To get to the next station in time, hikers must follow a 40min/mile pace. " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -72.0370726, 43.8657975 ] } },

Here, hikers are treated to breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and snacks. It is still dark up, but in the span of different teams coming through, the sun rose. Here, hiker morale is higher despite being more fatigued and having more blisters on their feet. Hikers were also pretty delirious: a hiker told me that there was an elephant chasing me and another (good friend of mine) asked me if I got my nose pierced (I did not). \n\nThe next section of the hike is the most brutal: 9.5 miles, 3138 ft of elevation gain. Hikers will have to summit Moose Mountain, notoriously the most difficult section of the hike. The Hiker Feedback Form had some very colorful language to describe this section of the hike, rightfully so. At a pace of 35min/mile while being absolutely exhausted, hikers must complete this section of the hike relatively quickly.

Here, Hikers are served Annie's Mac, a DOC staple and energy-dense food. At this station, half the groups were half zombies and the other half were strangely energized. Some hikers even decided to change into sandles (Chacos) to finish this last leg of the hike. Since this leg of the hike was near morning, there were lots of A.T. hikers that came through and chatted with us. We gave them extra food and water. \n\nThis last section of the hike is 9 miles with 1114 ft of elevation gain. Despite being arguably the most relaxed, this section of the hike is quite brutal as hikers are quite battered at this point. To account for this, hikers needed to follow at 40min/mile pace to get back to campus in a reasonable amount of time. During this portion of the hike, hikers will go through Velvet Rocks.
