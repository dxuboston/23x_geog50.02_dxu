    <h2><u>Introduction To The Fifty</u></h2>
    <p>
      The Fifty is a Dartmouth College tradition during which students across class years hike ~56 miles from Moosilauke Ravine Lodge all the way back to campus.
      Barring the first short leg of the hike, the majority of the hike (~50 miles) occurs on the section of the Appalachian Trail that the Dartmouth Outing Club maintains.
      This tradition occurs twice a year, once during Fall Term and another during Summer Term.
    </p>
    <a id="introduction"></a>
    <p>
      The event is an endurance hike, but it is also a Dartmouth tradition that brings together people from every corner of campus to cheer on both friends,
      peers, and strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its title, the intention of the Fifty is not to hike 50 miles. If you pushed yourself and had fun, then you have embodied the spirit of the Fifty.
      This event brings together people across Dartmouth's campus to celebrate the outdoors and each other. It is truly a special thing to watch hikers charge
      through the "Tunnel of Love" to slap the DOC sign outside of Robinson Hall, officially marking the end of the Fifty, with complete strangers giving their
      peers the most joyous hug of their lives.

        <div class="card">
            <h2><u><center>Direct</center></u></h2>
            <p>For each Fifty, there are three directors. These directors should be from a range of experiences and identities. They should 
                be representative of the entire College, instead of just the DOC. While it is not necessary that all three directors are the 
                most experienced hikers, adequate outdoors skills should be represented between the cohort. Usually, this means that at least 
                one of the directors have hiked the Fifty before. All directors are given an auto-entry into a subsequent Fifty should they 
                choose to hike. 
            </p>
            <p>The three positions are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hiker Coordinator</li>
                <p>
                    This director is the point person for all things related to hikers. 
                </p>
                <li>Supporter Coordinator</li>
                <p>
                    This director is charged with managing, organizing, and coralling all supporters. 
                </p>
                <li>Logistics Coordinator</li>
                <p>
                    This director is responsible for coordinating all of the moving pieces in organizing the event (i.e. Food order, 
                    vans, gear rentals, managing train conditions, coordinating with the Outdoor Programs Office and other officials, etc.).

        <div class="card">
            <h2><u>Hike</u></h2>
            <a id="about"></a>
            <p>Apply to hike the Fifty! There are usually eight teams of four hikers, though there can be more or less depending on 
                circumstances. To apply to hike, you must attend the Fifty Information Session, usually at the beginning of the term. 
                You must apply as a team of four undergraduate students. 
            </p>
            <p> Some things to consider before applying: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Group dynamics of your potential team</li>
                <li>Am I in adequate condition (physically, mentally, and emotionally) to embark on this hike?</li>
                <li>Do I even like hiking?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2><u>Support</u></h2>
            <p>Sign up to support the Fifty! Without the ~80 volunteers that man the support stations, this event could not happen. 
                Supporting is an incredible time. Supporters are stationed at different spots along the trail. While supporting, you 
                get to dress up in flair and cheer on friends who might be hiking, or complete strangers. Regardless, supporters play a crucial 
                role in the event. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <p>Roles might include: </p>
                <li>Station Captain</li>
                <p>
                    Station captains serve as a point person for each station. Directors communicate logistics with the station captains who will 
                    they pass along information to their station's supporters. They ensure that the support station is functional and on-time during
                    the event. They also decide on the theme of their station. 
                </p>
                <li>Safety Dork</li>
                <p>
                    Safety dorks are volunteers with a higher medical certification (OEC, WFR, EMT, etc.) that examine and treat hikers as they come through.
                    Hikers are not able to proceed with their hike until the Safety Dork signs off on them at each station. Safety Dorks also are responsible for 
                    deciding whether or not hikers are in adequate conditions to continue or if they need to be pulled. Once all the teams have gone through, 
                    Safety Dorks are also responsible for sweeping their leg of the trail to ensure that all hikers proceed safely. 
                </p>
                <li>Sweepers</li>
                <p>Along with the Safety Dork, sweepers are tasked with hiking from their station to the next to ensure that all hikers make it there safely. 
                    There are two sweepers in addition to the Safety Dork. 
                </p>
                <li>Supporter</li>
                <p>
                    The rest of the supporters are split up between stations and are responsible for other various tasks (cooking, serving food, 
                    sorting hiker belongings, etc.). Above all, supporters are responsible for bringing the energy and good vibes to keep spirits high.

    <h2><u>Reflections From Daniel Xu, 23X Hiker Coordinator</u></h2>
    <p>
      I had the opportunity to serve as Hiker Coordinator during the 23X Fifty. During this term, the event occurred from 7/14/2023 - 7/15/2023. There were nine teams, of which eight finished.
      However, a member from every team was able to finish. Due to the circumstances in which calls came in and the logistics of phone signal,
      I was lucky to be the director in the field the most. This, of course, meant that I was the one who slept the least and had the least down time.
      I remember writing a paper in the pitch dark rain in my car at Jacob's Brook an hour before it was due, frantically typing to get the assignment
      in on time. Then, I had to drive a half hour to a location with phone signal so that I could create a hotspot to submit the assignment to Canvas. I was
      able to do this before the first group of hikers arrived at the station. Despite the chaos, I wouldn't have it any other way. Considering the staggeringly poor trail conditions,
      this was a miracle. Some hikers hike it just to say that they did, others hike it to commemorate their Abenaki heritage. Regardless, the different values assigned
      to this tradition make it so much more than a really long walk in the woods.
