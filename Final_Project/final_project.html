    <h2><u>Introduction To The Fifty</u></h2>
        <p>
            The Fifty is a Dartmouth College tradition during which students across class years hike ~56 miles from Moosilauke Ravine Lodge all the way back to campus. 
            Barring the first short leg of the hike, the majority of the hike (~50 miles) occurs on the section of the Appalachian Trail that the Dartmouth Outing Club maintains. 
            This tradition occurs twice a year, once during Fall Term and another during Summer Term.
        </p>
        <p>
            The event is an endurance hike, but it is also a Dartmouth tradition that brings together people from every corner of campus to cheer on both friends, 
            peers, and strangers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite its title, the intention of the Fifty is not to hike 50 miles. If you pushed yourself and had fun, then you have embodied the spirit of the Fifty. 
            This event brings together people across Dartmouth's campus to celebrate the outdoors and each other. It is truly a special thing to watch hikers charge 
            through the "Tunnel of Love" to slap the DOC sign outside of Robinson Hall, officially marking the end of the Fifty, with complete strangers giving their 
            peers the most joyous hug of their lives.

            I had the opportunity to serve as Hiker Coordinator during the 23X Fifty. During this term, the event occurred from 7/14/2023 - 7/15/2023. There were nine teams, of which eight finished. 
            However, a member from every team was able to finish. Considering the staggeringly poor trail conditions, 
            this was a miracle. Some hikers hike it just to say that they did, others hike it to commemorate their Abenaki heritage. Regardless, the different values assigned 
            to this tradition make it so much more than a really long walk in the woods.

    <h2><u>Reflections From Daniel Xu, 23X Hiker Coordinator</u></h2>
    <p>
        I had the opportunity to serve as Hiker Coordinator during the 23X Fifty. During this term, the event occurred from 7/14/2023 - 7/15/2023. There were nine teams, of which eight finished. 
        However, a member from every team was able to finish. Due to the circumstances in which calls came in and the logistics of phone signal, 
        I was lucky to be the director in the field the most. This, of course, meant that I was the one who slept the least and had the least down time. 
        I remember writing a paper in the pitch dark rain in my car at Jacob's Brook an hour before it was due, frantically typing to get the assignment 
        in on time. Then, I had to drive a half hour to a location with phone signal so that I could create a hotspot to submit the assignment to Canvas. I was 
        able to do this before the first group of hikers arrived at the station. Despite the chaos, I wouldn't have it any other way. Considering the staggeringly poor trail conditions, 
        this was a miracle. Some hikers hike it just to say that they did, others hike it to commemorate their Abenaki heritage. Regardless, the different values assigned 
        to this tradition make it so much more than a really long walk in the woods.
