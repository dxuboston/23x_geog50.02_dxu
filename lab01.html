    <h1>What I Ate Today</h1>
    <p>My breakfast is typically a ritual. I eat the same things in the morning every day. I wake up, go to FoCo, and get my classic scrambled eggs and oatmeal.
    I put hot sauce on my eggs and brown sugar in my oatmeal, and it is awesome. I sit down on Lightside and listen to the FoCo music bump. 
    Then, I am on my way to class.</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
