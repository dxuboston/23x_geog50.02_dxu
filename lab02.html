    <h1>What I Ate for Breakfast</h1>
    <p>My breakfast is typically a ritual. I eat the same things in the morning every day. 
        I wake up, go to FoCo, and get my classic scrambled eggs and oatmeal. 
        I put hot sauce on my eggs and brown sugar in my oatmeal, and it is awesome. 
        I sit down on Lightside and listen to the FoCo music bump. Then, I am on my way to 
        whatever it is I have going on that day. However, before I leave, I always take a 
        muffin (or whatever delectable baked good is available) for the road. 
    </p>
    <h2>What I Ate for Lunch</h2>
    <p>For lunchtime, I am usually pretty hungry. This is because I have class before lunch 
    always, which is somewhat a rule for me. FoCo, especially in the summer, is usually
    pretty terrible for lunch. This means I usually have the special if it is edible, 
    or I get a smoked turkey sub from the deli section, with just a dash of honey mustard. 
    I usually will couple this with a banana or another piece of fruit. Yum!</p>
